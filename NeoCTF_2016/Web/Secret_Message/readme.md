The basic setup of this site is a marquee that displays one letter at a time, and then gets cut off at a certain point. The message itself could be found at http://162.243.0.171/msg.php, albeit obfuscated. My solution was to copy the html source, caopy and paste the obfuscated message and rewrite the bits that connected to the server, and comment out all of the interruptions. I also changed the delay between letters to something smaller so I didn't have to wait. 

A few seconds after the message ends, the flag appears.
