Description: Adam is a mess whenever he eats and he has developed this weird algorithm for the number of napkins (n) he needs for the given number of apples (a), bananas (b), cherries (c), and donuts (d) he is eating. If he is eating 1 apple, 2 cherries, and 3 donuts, how many bananas will he need to eat if he wants to use a total of 13,333,337 napkins?

The file is his algorithm in C++.

Enter a number as the answer.

My solution was to translate the program to python, write in the given a,c, and d, and brute force b. Turns out it got it pretty quick.
