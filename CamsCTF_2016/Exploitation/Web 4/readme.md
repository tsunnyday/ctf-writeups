The problem says the password is what you get when you evaluate bar("barr")
for 

var a = "b";var b = "a";function bar( barr ){return barr( barr ) + a + b + c + barr( barr );}function barr(){return "k";}var c = "r";

This is terrible code, but from brief examination, we get "k" + "b" + "a" + "r" + "k", so password is "kbark"

Flag is {variables_n_functionz}
