A weird problem. Shifting 5, like the title tells us too, gives us 
flag€6syitystillyt55yeas~Y‚

Shifting the numbers by 5 and substituting the brackets gives us:

flag{1syitystillyt00yeas~Y}

But it's still not there. The y's look suspicious anyway. I went back and only did the caesar on letters that weren't d or D.

flag{1sditdstilldt00yeas~D}

Now if we take an ascii table and go back five on the characters we still haven't messed with yet (d, D, and ~), we get

flag(1s_it_still_t00_easy?}
