We find ourselves at web.camsctf.com/11/denied.html, with 

"My Jelly and Sandwich cookie says you're not authorized." - C4pt4in Troll

Hmm. Jelly and Sandwich. J and S. JS cookie. We can still view the source of web.camsctf.com/11 and see what information goes into the cookies, but we don't really need much. The page adds two new cookies, auth with a value of 0 and password with a value of such_js_cookiez. If we just change auth to 1 we can access web.camsctf.com/11, which looks just like the last one, except for the password such_js_cookiez works, and gives us the flag, {americans_and_sweet_things}
